----Feedback from peer-reviewer----

Hi! I think you did a great job overall. Files are deployed under appropriate directories. All the code chunks in the .qmd file are named in a very 
explicit way.

Some minor comments I have are:

1)	When I knit the .qmd file, the output html file is created under the `src` folder instead of the `doc` folder. I think you can change the directory of the output object from the header of the .qmd file. 

2)	If we want to have self-contained output html file, we could add the following to the header of the .qmd file.

format:
  html:
    self-contained: true

3)	When writing functions, the tidyverse style guide does not put a space after the function name. For example, from the line 142 of your .qmd file, we could write,

compute_cbr <- function(population_data) {

Remember to put spaces after commas (see line 279). You may want to add some extra spaces to align parts of code. 
For example check lines 74-77 and 128-130. Also, revise the indentation rules for lines 144-146 (these lines should be aligned with each other). 

It is good you took the code for writing paths relative to the root of the project. However, the example should several alternatives; 
it would be preferable that you choose one of them rather than mixing them. 

In your answer to question 5, you are not presenting any results. 
Show what was computed (as needed) to give support to your response. 

Lastly, you may programmatically include the results instead of hand writing the values in your answers. 
For example, on line 417, use `r kenya_cdr[1]`. 

Excellent work naming the chunks and answering the questions. 
Your document was really easy to read.
