1) Update the output object directory to create it under the "doc" folder.
(Metacomments: I attempted this by modifying the directory of the output object in the header of the .qmd file, 
but it didn't yield the desired outcome. I'll give it another try to resolve this issue.)

2) Ensure the qmd file is self-contained.

3) Eliminate spaces after function names to maintain the tidy style.

----

4) Add spaces after commas (e.g., line 279). Also, align the lines (e.g., 74-77, 128-130). 
Adjust the indentation for lines 144-146 to ensure proper alignment.

5) Standardize the use of a single method to write relative paths and remove any alternative approaches.

6) For question 5, provide the code that demonstrates your computations to support your interpretation.

7) Dynamically include the results instead of manually writing values in the answers 
(e.g., on line 417, use `r kenya_cdr[1]`).
